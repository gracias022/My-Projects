If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

SQL:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence). AVG(danceability)
FROM songs

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Every song has equal weightage in determining the average scores for energy, valence and danceability,
which means songs that are ranked lower could influence the final average values as much as those most favoured by the listener.

A better way could be calculating the weighted average, assigning different weightages to different songs based on each respective song's ranking on the list.
